> Projects built on [Jev](https://typesafe.ai), TypeSafe AI's System One model. Curated by Jev itself.

Every repository here was collected from GitHub, then judged by Jev in a single call: is it genuinely about Jev, which category, which decision pattern, and how substantial, documented, and novel it is. Code applies the policy; nothing below was hand-picked. The full index with probabilities lives on the site, along with the [review queue](https://awesome-jev.xyz/review) of borderline cases.

This is an independent community project, not affiliated with TypeSafe AI. Jev and System One are TypeSafe AI product names.

![Pipeline: GitHub search and community lists feed candidates into code, Jev judges each repository in one call, code applies the policy with human overrides, and the README and site are published daily.](docs/diagrams/pipeline.png)

## How This List Is Made

Discover: GitHub repository search, code search for SDK usage, and links from other community lists. Enrich: README excerpt, file listing, manifest dependencies, and activity metadata. Judge: one Jev call per repository with 11 typed questions, gates as Noul, category and pattern as Choice, substance, docs, and novelty as Score. Curate: code applies thresholds and weights to the stored judgments, so changing policy never re-runs inference. Publish: this README and the site are generated from `data/curated.json` every day.

Question set `v2`, model `jev-1.13.0`. The calibration against human labels is on the [how it works](https://awesome-jev.xyz/how-it-works) page.
